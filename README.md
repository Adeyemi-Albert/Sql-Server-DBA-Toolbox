# Sql Server DBA Toolbox
Welcome to my box of tricks (SQL scripts) for Microsoft SQL Server instance and database administration!

I've put considerable effort, over many years, into creating my own scripts, as well as adapting the efforts of many other talented folk in the SQL Server community, to help with my day-to-day job as a Database Administrator on Microsoft SQL Server. Now that I'm approaching the twilight of my professional IT career, I wanted to ensure that this accumulated DBA knowledge store is not lost but is instead shared as widely as possible.

My experience is that **having the right tool for the job** is half the battle (*and knowing how to wield it is the other!*), and so I wanted to be able to share as widely as possible these tools that I use: some every day, some frequently, and some only occasionally. But they all deserve a place in my toolbox!

When faced with a SQL Server DBA challenge, don't re-invent the wheel or give it up as too hard: check my toolbox and the blogs of the many generous SQL giants out there on whose shoulders we stand!

I hope you find them useful.
